Git Pages is my favorite way to host static web apps without spinning up complex infrastructure. Deploys are just a git push, hosting stays free for open source projects, and the CDN keeps content close to whoever visits.

Everything currently lives on GitHub Pages, but I’m preparing a disaster-recovery setup that mirrors the same artifacts on GitLab Pages. The more layers I have, the easier it is to experiment in the lab without worrying about downtime.

To take advantage of this approach each app must be 100% client-side, using modern browser APIs. If a project needs a dedicated backend, I publish it through a different stack—Git Pages plays the role of a fast showcase.
